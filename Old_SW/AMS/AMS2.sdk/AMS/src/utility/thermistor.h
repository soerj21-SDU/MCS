* \brief    Converts the ADC result into a temperature value.

*           P1 and p2 are the interpolating point just before and after the
*           ADC value. The function interpolates between these two points
*           The resulting code is very small and fast.
*           Only one integer multiplication is used.
*           The compiler can replace the division by a shift operation.
